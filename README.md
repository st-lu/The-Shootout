## The-Shootout
 Zero-player game using OOP paradigms.

 * Grenadiers regenerate health every time they kill or wound an enemy depending on their overall kill count. They use grenades
 * Snipers deal increased damage. They use Sniper Rifles
 * Soldiers have the power of Brotherhood. Kill one and another one comes to reinforce him. A soldier can call for reinforcements up to 5 times. However, adrenaline points are lost. They use rifles
 * Spies can deal more damage depending on how much health they have left. They use revolvers.
Each character is equipped with a bulletproof vest except for spies.
